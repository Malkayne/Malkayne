# Kayode “Mhista” Owoseni (Malkayne) — Backend Engineer (PHP / Laravel)

> I build backend systems and developer-facing platforms, and I ship full-stack features when needed.
> Focus areas: **Laravel**, APIs, platform architecture, and clean, maintainable code.

## About me

* Backend developer working with **PHP & Laravel** (currently contributing to UZEL Fintech).
* Frontend experience from an HNG internship (responsive UI, small React/vanilla JS projects).
* I design and implement features for learning-focused and fintech platforms (see **TribePeer** and other repos).
* Always improving: documenting, writing tests, and making dev workflows smoother.

---

## Tech stack

* **Primary:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Eloquent, REST APIs
* **Frontend & tooling:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, basic React (projects & prototypes)
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Composer, npm, basic CLI workflows

---

## Highlighted projects

* **TribePeer** — peer-to-peer learning platform
  *Features I worked on:* authentication, profile pages, tribes/feeds layout, peers & messaging workflows, tutor dashboard design.
* **UZEL Fintech** — backend services and integrations (Laravel) — ongoing work.
* **HNG Internship Projects** — profile card, color-guessing game, and other frontend challenges demonstrating responsive UI and interactivity.
* **Study & tooling:** generating Q/A content (e.g., Wood Engineering notes) and automating developer tasks.

(For details and code, check repositories in this profile.)

## How I work / What I value

* **Readable code** and clear commit messages.
* Small, iterative PRs with focused acceptance criteria and test cases.
* Documentation included with features (README + basic run instructions).
* Communicate in tickets with clear “what” and “why” (I follow a Trello-based story/acceptance format).
